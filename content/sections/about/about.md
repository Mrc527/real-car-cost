Do you know how much your car actually costs?
The Real Car Cost is a project for calculating it, showing what the difference is between what you think your car costs and what actually you have to pay for having it.

Portfolio Minimal is a Gatsby Theme that creates outstanding one-pages portfolio within minutes!

It has predefined sections for your bio, skills, projects, and contact details. If you are a writer on Medium, you can integrate your latest articles in a distinct section as well. While building the theme, I tried to keep the setup as simple as possible while keeping everything configurable if you like to.

Using theme composition, you can easily customize the CSS theme to your own preferences - e.g. change colors, fonts, etc.

Last but not least, it has some cool features you can opt-in to: Dark Mode, Splash Screen, Cookie Banner, and more to find out :)
